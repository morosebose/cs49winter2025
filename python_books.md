# Python Resources

## Official sites

- The [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) from the developers of the language. 
- The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). Generally not beginner-friendly, but it is the final authority on which all other resources rely. Here, for example, is the official description of the [if statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-if-statement).

## Beginner-friendly sites
- [Python tutorial at W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). Videos and exercises to guide you through the language. Also great for looking up specific concepts. The explanations are much more beginner-friendly than those on the official Python documentation. Contrast the w3s explanation of [if statements](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp) with the official one above.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language-tutorial/) also has a Python tutorial and elementary explanations of concepts. Here is the G4G explanation of [if statements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/conditional-statements-in-python/).
- The [Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) at the official Python site lists several other sites geared toward those learning to program.

## Online books (free, legal) 
- Allen B. Downey's free online book [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/) is used as a textbook for CS 3A, Object Oriented Programming Methodologies in Python, by at least one Foothill professor.
- Michael Driscoll's [Python 101](https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/) is also very systematic in its approach.
