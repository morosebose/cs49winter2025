spread_beepers.py

Karel needs to spread out a pile of beepers to cover as many consecutive corners 
as there are beepers. 
Note: (1) Karel does not know how to count 
    (2) Karel's bag has infinite beepers
    (3) The row is long enough to accommodate all beepers in its pile
    (4) A beeper will never need to be placed in the last column of a row.
